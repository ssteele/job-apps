Dear **EMPLOYER**,

I want to be your new **POSITION**. I have been building and maintaining web sites and applications for nearly a decade. I come from a solid PHP/Javascript background. I offer experience with a wide array of programming languages and design patterns. Iâ€™ve had success working in many environments: from free-flowing agencies tackling many projects to software teams collaborating on larger applications. I have worked remotely for the last few years.

I have years of experience developing REST APIs and have used many front and backend MVC/MVVM frameworks. **ADD APPROPRIATE SKILLS**. I enjoy TDD development where appropriate. I love learning and trying new things.

Please find attached my resume, which documents my educational and professional experience. You can find samples of my work at steve-steele.com. I look forward to hearing from you. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Steve Steele
