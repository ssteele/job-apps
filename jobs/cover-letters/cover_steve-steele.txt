Dear EMPLOYER,

I am interested in being your new POSITION. I have been developing and maintaining web site and application front- and back-ends for several years now. I have a proven record of working both independently and with a team of other developers.

I’ve had success working within a range of environments, from small dev shop, to large and hectic agency, to that same large but less hectic agency operating under a more agile-like ideal. I come from a solid PHP/jQuery background and I’ve gained much experience with responsive, modular SASS working with MasterCard, Intel, and the PGA. I’ve also worked with Laravel, Node.js, and Bootstrap (though I prefer Foundation).

Please find attached my resume, which documents my educational and professional experience. You can find samples of my work at my website (steve-steele.com). I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Steve Steele
